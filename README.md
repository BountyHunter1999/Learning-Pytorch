# Learning-Pytorch
This Repo is a step by step way on which I learned Pytorch from a book 

# What Can We Do
## 1. Identify Images 
 [CODE](https://github.com/BountyHunter1999/Learning-Pytorch/blob/main/Looking_Into_Deep_Learning_Models_1_RESNET.ipynb)
- we looked at a pretrained resnet network with 101 layers
- we provided an image to this network and found it be a golden retriever

## 2. Change objects from one form to another
[CODE]()
- we'll be seeing the magic of GANs
- we're trying to convert all the horses in the picture to zebras (only horses)
- here we'll use `ResNetGenerator` 
-
